//  ADR 0143 SC2 F-1 / ledger Owed #2 — the PUBLIC way a host registers a concrete
//  workflow effect factory WITHOUT naming the internal IWorkflowEffectFactory.
//
//  Owed #2 named an [InternalsVisibleTo]-granted effects-adapter assembly. This is a
//  DELIBERATE deviation to the SAME end, chosen because it is STRICTLY TIGHTER: the
//  factory interface stays fully `internal` — exposed to NO external assembly (not even
//  a trusted one) — so it removes the one residual crack the ledger itself names ("if an
//  apps/ assembly were ever [InternalsVisibleTo]-granted, type containment would compile
//  for it → the fence evaporates for that assembly"). A host registers an effect by
//  handing in a BUILD DELEGATE, which this package captures inside the `internal`
//  DelegateWorkflowEffectFactory; the delegate is invoked ONLY by the broker (the sole
//  Build caller — arch-tested). No external assembly can name the factory, resolve it
//  from DI, or reach another capability's Build. See the PR (b) deviation note.
//
//  WHY host-side, not a shared adapter package: a real WorkflowEffect stages its rows
//  onto the host's in-flight unit-of-work (LocalNodeDbContext) — an app type a package
//  cannot reference. So the concrete build closure is inherently host-coupled (exactly as
//  NodeLiveInvoiceApprovalContext.BuildPostEffect is). The delegate API lets the host
//  supply that closure through a PUBLIC seam while the factory type stays contained.
