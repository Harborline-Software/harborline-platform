/// <c>blocks-workflow</c>) depends only on this contract; the recoverable EF/SQLite implementation
/// (<c>apps/local-node-host</c>, <c>NodeEfWorkflowStore</c>) rides the existing
/// <c>LocalNodeDbContext</c> + the ADR-0126 enlister so a step's effect, its outcome event, its
/// idempotency row, and the instance position co-commit in ONE store transaction
/// (<b>build invariant #1</b> — atomic advance).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>The seam is deliberately small.</b> Per ADR 0135's rule-of-three re-scope, slice 1 builds the
/// irreducible core (instances / events / idempotency + atomic advance + park/resume + the 4 triggers)
/// and DEFERS the general step-graph executor + saga runner until a third real waiting-case lands. The
/// contract therefore exposes the few operations whose <b>atomicity</b> is load-bearing — not a general
/// step-graph API.

/// <b>Effect-agnostic advance.</b> <see cref="AdvanceAsync"/> takes a <see cref="WorkflowEffect"/> — an
/// opaque enlistment the impl stages onto its in-flight unit-of-work BEFORE the single commit — so the

/// this seam). This keeps <c>blocks-workflow</c> free of any financial-cluster dependency.
