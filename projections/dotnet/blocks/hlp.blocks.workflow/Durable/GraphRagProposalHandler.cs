// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  Handler C (ADR 0135 KG-search Slice 2-actions) — a proposed CP action from a
//  grounded GraphRAG proposal → human-CP-gate → execute-as-the-human.
//
//  The third named CP-park handler (rule-of-three: NO general step-graph executor —
//  each named CP process is a hand-audited handler). Implements IWorkflowStepHandler;
//  the engine core supplies the durable plumbing (idempotency guard, atomic advance,
//  park/resume) around it. It is the structural realization of G-G4: a proposed CP
//  action NEVER executes without a human approve — it PARKS, and only the human approve
//  resumes the engine to the execute step. The model PROPOSES, the human ACTS.
//
//  Flow (steps: decide → [approve] → execute / rejected):
//    decide   — ALWAYS PARK on the `approve` human-task, carrying the FE-1 basis (the
//               proposal text + the proposed action summary + the grounding-path basis
//               + the asserted/inferred provenance + the TAINT label). There is NO
//               auto-approve branch: a proposed CP action is CP, full stop — it always
//               parks (unlike the invoice handler, whose under-threshold case is an AP
//               auto-post). The execute step is NEVER reached from `decide`.
//    approve  — on a human-action result:
//                 * approve   → advance to `execute`, attaching the CP execution effect.
//                   This is the ONLY way the CP `execute` step is reached — the human
//                   approval IS the gate (ADR 0135 §Prerequisites, the v1 human-task
//                   interim). The effect runs the EXISTING CP path "as the human".
//                 * reject    → terminal advance to `rejected`, NO effect (nothing runs).
//                 * send-back → park back on `decide` (round-trip; the operator can
//                   re-review). A bounded loop-back (A0 cap applies).
//
//  G-G4 invariant (arch-tested BY NAME, the slice DoD gate): the `decide` step ALWAYS
//  returns Park on the approve human-task — there is NO path from decide to execute. The
//  only path to `execute` is the approve human-action. An INJECTED grounding that proposes
//  a malicious action lands here too: it PARKS to the human, who sees the basis (incl. the
//  injected text + the taint label) and rejects — there is no autonomous action even when
//  the grounding is adversarial.
//
//  Generation-free + financial-free: the handler reads the proposal/action basis + builds
//  the CP execution effect through IKgActionApprovalContext, which the host implements over
//  the KG-generation layer + the existing CP executor. blocks-workflow takes NO dependency
//  on the Generation layer or the financial cluster.
