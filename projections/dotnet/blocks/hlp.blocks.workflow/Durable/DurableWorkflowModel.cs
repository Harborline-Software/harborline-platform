//  The durable process model — the 3 store tables (ADR 0135 D2) as provider-neutral
//  POCOs, plus the lifecycle status, the D7 definition version, and the trigger model.
//
//  These types live in blocks-workflow (slice 2 — the engine core) and carry NO EF
//  dependency. The recoverable EF/SQLite store (apps/local-node-host) maps them onto
//  LocalNodeDbContext so {effect + outcome event + idempotency row + position} co-commit
//  in ONE SQLite transaction (build invariant #1).
