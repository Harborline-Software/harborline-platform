/// idempotency row) and, before A0, recorded no counter, so a pathological caller could ping-pong the instance
/// forever (an unbounded loop / latent DoS, bug-1353). The cap turns the bounded loop into an actually-bounded
/// one: at <see cref="MaxIterations"/> the dispatcher ESCALATES the instance to a terminal failed state for
/// operator action instead of re-parking. The counter that the cap reads is the durable, read-back-on-resume
/// <see cref="WorkflowInstanceRecord.Iteration"/> (never recomputed — bug-1337 class), so the cap is itself
/// crash-stable.
