// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  ADR 0143 D1 — the .NET broker-PEP (the fixed enforcement point). The .NET
//  runtime analog of the carrier-sdk `ProposalBroker` (propose→confirm) named by
//  ADR 0143 R1-B/F1 as owed-with-the-build. It is the effect-execution boundary:
//  the SINGLE code path through which a workflow step obtains a stageable
//  WorkflowEffect for a registered capability. It does NOT decide policy — it
//  ENFORCES it: it derives the CP/AP class from the canonical authority registry
//  (ADR 0128; unknown⇒CP), forces OutboundExternal effects to CP (the R1-E
//  data-exfil residual), and gates a CP effect behind confirm-time SoD
//  (D-INV-5, reusing the shipped HumanApprovalHandlerBase.EnsureApproverSeparationOfDuties)
//  before it will build the effect via the (host-supplied) IWorkflowEffectFactory.
//
//  NO SIDE DOOR (SC2). The broker is the ONLY caller of IWorkflowEffectFactory.Build
//  (arch-tested: WorkflowEffectFactoryArchitectureTests). The engine core is
//  financial-free (arch-tested: WorkflowEngineIsFinancialFreeArchitectureTests), so
//  an interpreter/handler CANNOT reach a real CP side-effect except by asking this
//  broker for it — which for a CP capability means a human confirm that passes SoD.
//
//  Two paths, mutually exclusive by class:
//    • AP capability  → BuildAutonomousEffect  (no human; refuses if the capability is CP).
//    • CP capability  → ConfirmAndBuildEffect   (SoD-gated human confirm; refuses if the capability is AP).
//  Both refuse an UNREGISTERED capability (no factory ⇒ nothing to build, fail-closed).
