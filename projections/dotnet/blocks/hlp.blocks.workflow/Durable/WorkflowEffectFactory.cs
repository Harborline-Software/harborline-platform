// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  WF-KEY / ADR 0143 — the EFFECT-FACTORY registry (the .NET effect-execution
//  boundary named by ADR 0143 R1-B/F1). This is the fence the broker-PEP guards:
//  the ONLY way an authored/interpreted workflow step can produce a real domain
//  side-effect (a posted JE, an outbound notification) is a registered
//  IWorkflowEffectFactory, and a factory is invoked ONLY from inside the
//  WorkflowEffectBroker (arch-tested — WorkflowEngineEnforcementSeamArchitectureTests +
//  WorkflowEffectFactoryContainmentTests).
//
//  TYPE-LEVEL CONTAINMENT (SC2 F-1, 2026-07-02 seam-review). The fence is NOT a
//  name-coupled source-scan (a rename/registry-injection evaded that — proven). It is
//  COMPILER-enforced by C# accessibility, split across two surfaces:
//    • PUBLIC  IWorkflowEffectCatalog       → metadata ONLY (IsEffectingCapability /
//      EffectKeyFor). What an interpreter / the admission validator legitimately needs
//      to tell an effecting step from a decision step. It CANNOT hand out a factory.
//    • INTERNAL IWorkflowEffectFactory (+ its Build), IWorkflowEffectFactoryResolver
//      (Resolve), WorkflowEffectFactoryRegistry, WorkflowEffectBroker → the resolve+build
//      surface. `internal` to blocks-workflow, so ONLY same-assembly code (the broker) can
//      obtain a live factory and invoke Build. A concrete host factory implements the
//      internal IWorkflowEffectFactory ONLY from an assembly this package explicitly grants
//      via [InternalsVisibleTo] (a deliberate, reviewed trust grant — PR (b)'s effects
//      adapter) — NOT "anyone who can resolve the DI service". An apps/ interpreter that
//      injects IWorkflowEffectCatalog gets metadata and no way to reach Build; it cannot
//      even NAME IWorkflowEffectFactoryResolver / IWorkflowEffectFactory to attempt the
//      Resolve().Build() bypass (compile error). The regression fence is the reflection
//      red-team test in WorkflowEffectFactoryContainmentTests (goes red if the surface is
//      re-publicized — the way the reviewer proved the old hole open).
//
//  FINANCIAL-FREE ENGINE CORE. The factory INTERFACE lives here (blocks-workflow),
//  but every CONCRETE factory that touches a domain effect (the JE-posting factory
//  that calls IJournalPostingService) lives in the host / financial cluster. The
//  engine core hands the broker a WorkflowEffect closure (IWorkflowStore.WorkflowEffect)
//  and never references the financial cluster — the same layering IWorkflowStore uses.
//  Enforced by WorkflowEngineIsFinancialFreeArchitectureTests.
//
//  The `EffectKey` is the marker ADR 0135 A1 R-1 names: "a step carrying a non-null
//  EffectKey". In the declarative model, a step's effect is its ActionBinding's
//  CapabilityRef; the EffectKey binds that CapabilityRef to a concrete factory + its
//  reach (Internal vs OutboundExternal).
