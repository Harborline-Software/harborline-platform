/// handler stays a NAMED <see cref="IWorkflowStepHandler"/> whose CP-park is still arch-tested by name, and
/// whose per-handler logic (the invoice D7 threshold table; the grant F-1 authority re-resolve +
/// at-approve attenuation re-check) stays as host code in the handler. That is the §3 "deduplicate the
/// scaffolding without data-driving the control flow" scope — the safety property is untouched, and the
/// definition interpreter (slice A1) is deferred.

/// genuinely different decision surfaces (one sync + a decision table; two async + an authority provider),
/// different state payloads, and different typed-outcome sets. Forcing them under one abstract base would
/// couple unrelated logic. A shared static parser captures the byte-identical part (the real duplication the
/// verdict named) with zero coupling of the divergent part — the smallest change that retires the three copies.
