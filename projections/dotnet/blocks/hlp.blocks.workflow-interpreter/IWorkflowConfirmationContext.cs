//  the confirm request body:
//    • the CONFIRMER   — resolved from the ambient authenticated principal (party via
//      IPartyContext, human/agent via IPrincipalKindResolver) at the confirm boundary;
//    • the PROPOSER    — the autonomous engine that reached + parked the CP action. An
//      autonomously-parked CP action is treated as AGENT-proposed (IsHuman = false), the
//      security-conservative default: separation-of-duties then ALWAYS requires a distinct
//      human confirmer (an engine can never self-confirm its own CP proposal).
//
//  The host implements this over its real principal context. The interpreter takes it as a
//  dependency so "who confirms" is a server fact, giving the broker's ConfirmAndBuildEffect
//  a confirmer/proposer it can run the shipped SoD rule against.
