/// <summary>
/// Book a demand into a free slot (Slice S3, <b>Direction A</b> — book demand INTO availability). A
/// patient into a doctor's free slot: create a <see cref="Occupancy.Bookable"/> event that consumes
/// availability, enforcing <b>no-double-book</b> on the resource. The search-and-book core of the
/// near-term schedule Module.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>No-double-book is enforced in-block, against free/busy.</b> A booking is admitted only when its
/// slot is (a) inside an availability window and (b) free of existing occupancy — both read straight
/// off <see cref="IFreeBusyService"/> (<c>free = availability − ALL occupancy</c>). This is the
/// natural single-node guard: free/busy already computes the busy intervals, so the conflict check is
/// a containment test against the free slots. No new state, no separate lock.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Seam to the CP reservation coordinator (noted, not wired).</b> The fleet's
/// <c>blocks-scheduling.IScheduleReservationCoordinator</c> is the <i>CP-class</i> write front-door:
/// it serializes reservation writes through a kernel Flease lease so two <i>nodes</i> cannot
/// double-book across a quorum (paper §2.2 "resource reservations → CP via distributed lease").
/// Taking a <c>ProjectReference</c> on <c>blocks-scheduling</c> here would drag the kernel-lease CP
/// machinery (and a Blazor scheduler UI) into this pure-domain block — the wrong dependency direction
/// (the S2 README already records this fence). So <see cref="IBookingService"/> enforces the
/// <i>single-node</i> no-double-book invariant locally; when a deployment needs cross-node
/// reservation serialization, a higher layer (the local-node-host / a pack) wires the booking through
/// <c>IScheduleReservationCoordinator</c> using the same UTC slot the booking produced
/// (<c>SlotReservation</c> is already <see cref="DateTimeOffset"/>-UTC, matching
/// <c>OccurrenceInstant</c>). The two compose; they are not merged here.
