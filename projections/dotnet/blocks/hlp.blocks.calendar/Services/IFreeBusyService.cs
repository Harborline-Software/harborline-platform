/// <b>Direction A (booking) substrate, coverage-ready.</b> Free/busy is the bookable surface for the
/// near-term booking model. It is computed from the <i>classified</i> event stream (the
/// <see cref="Occupancy"/> flag) — the same clean classified record a future coverage overlay reads
/// by context. The core never computes coverage; it exposes free/busy + by-context, the two
/// generic operations both booking and a coverage overlay build on.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Occupancy = which events make the resource busy.</b> Every non-cancelled event where the
/// resource appears (as the <see cref="CalendarEvent.ResourceRef"/> or any
/// <see cref="CalendarParticipation"/>) contributes its occurrence instants as busy time, regardless
/// of occupancy class — Bookable, Blocking, <i>and</i> Tentative all block a competing booking. The
/// occupancy <i>class</i> is carried so a vertical overlay can distinguish billable from blocking;
/// free/busy itself only cares that the time is occupied.
