/// <b>The grant tie, the right-sized way.</b> The schedule-feature design states visibility is "the
/// existing grant model applied to event fields, NOT a new scheduling concept". A grant decision
/// needs the heavyweight ADR 0117 substrate (<c>IPermissionResolver</c> / <c>IGrantStore</c> /
/// <c>ShipRole</c> / <c>ShipAction</c>), which lives in <c>blocks-access-grant</c> and its
/// authorization chain. Taking a <c>ProjectReference</c> on that from a pure-domain block would invert
/// the dependency direction (the same reason <see cref="ParticipantRef"/> stores id <i>values</i>
/// instead of referencing <c>blocks-assets</c>). So this block defines a thin policy <i>interface</i>
/// + a safe <see cref="OwnerOnlyEventDetailVisibilityPolicy"/> default; a host (the Bridge / a vertical
/// Pack) registers a grant-backed implementation that asks "does this principal hold a grant that
/// authorizes reading this event's detail?" — composing the existing model at the edge, exactly as the
/// design prescribes.

/// register the grant-backed policy leaks no private detail (busy-to-others is the safe degradation). A
