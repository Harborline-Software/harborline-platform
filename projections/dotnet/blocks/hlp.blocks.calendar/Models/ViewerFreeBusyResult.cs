/// A <b>viewer-scoped</b> free/busy result for one resource over a UTC window (Slice CALENDAR-LAYERS)
/// — the free slots (identical to <see cref="FreeBusyResult.FreeSlots"/>, visibility-independent) plus
/// the busy intervals as <see cref="BusyEvent"/>s whose detail is <i>redacted for events the viewing
/// principal is not authorized to see</i> (busy-to-others, detail-to-owner). The "show me this
/// resource's calendar AS principal P" query: P sees every busy slot (so it cannot double-book) but
/// only the detail of the events P is allowed to see.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Visibility never changes free/busy availability.</b> A private appointment still occupies the
/// resource and still blocks a competing booking — so <see cref="FreeSlots"/> is exactly the
/// availability-minus-all-occupancy free set, independent of the viewer. Only the <i>detail</i> of the
/// busy events is viewer-scoped. This keeps the booking-correctness invariant (a viewer who cannot see
/// a private appointment's detail still cannot book over it) intact.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="ResourceRef">The resource (Party or Asset) this free/busy was computed for.</param>
