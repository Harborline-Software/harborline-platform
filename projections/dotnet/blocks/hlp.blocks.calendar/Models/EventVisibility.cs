/// occupancy event (S3); the calendar-layers addition is <i>visibility</i>: free/busy shows the slot
/// as BUSY to others, but the event's detail fields (title, description, location, participants) are

/// <b>This is the existing access model applied to event FIELDS, not a new scheduling concept</b>
/// (schedule-feature design: "Visibility = the existing grant model applied to event fields, NOT a
/// new scheduling concept"). The calendar core carries the thin classification + the owner ref; the
/// authorization <i>decision</i> ("may principal P see this event's detail?") is the fleet grant
/// model's job (ADR 0117 / blocks-access-grant), wired at the Bridge / vertical layer — see the
/// noted seam on <see cref="Harborline.Blocks.Calendar.Services.IFreeBusyService"/> and
/// <see cref="Harborline.Blocks.Calendar.Services.IEventDetailVisibilityPolicy"/>. The block deliberately
/// does NOT take a <c>ProjectReference</c> on the heavyweight grant substrate
/// (<c>IPermissionResolver</c>/<c>IGrantStore</c>/<c>ShipRole</c>) — that would drag the authorization
/// chain into a pure-domain block (the same wrong-dependency-direction the <see cref="ParticipantRef"/>
/// design avoids for <c>blocks-assets</c>). Instead the block ships a pluggable
/// <c>IEventDetailVisibilityPolicy</c> seam whose default is the owner-only rule; a host registers a
/// grant-backed policy.

/// <b>The litmus (why visibility is NOT a free/busy field but occupancy is).</b> Free/busy reasons
/// about <i>occupancy</i> (does the time block a booking?) — so occupancy is a first-class common
/// field. Free/busy does NOT reason about <i>who may read the title</i> — so detail-visibility is a
/// thin classification + a projection (<c>busy-to-others</c> redacts detail), not something the
/// interval math touches. A <see cref="Private"/> event still occupies the resource and still blocks
/// a competing booking; only its detail is redacted in another principal's view.
