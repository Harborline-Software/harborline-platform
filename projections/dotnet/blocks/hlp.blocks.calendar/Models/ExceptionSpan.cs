/// A <b>supply-side availability exception over a whole-day DATE SPAN</b> — the calendar-layers
/// generalization of S3's single-day <see cref="ResourceAvailability.ExceptionDates"/> (Slice
/// CALENDAR-LAYERS). A vacation ("the doctor is off Mon 03-09 through Fri 03-13"), a clinic closure,
/// a holiday block: every availability window on every day in <c>[Start, End]</c> (inclusive of both
/// endpoints, whole-day granularity) is suppressed when the supply is expanded.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Whole-day, inclusive both ends.</b> Like an EXDATE, an exception span is date-granular — it
/// removes <i>entire days</i> of availability, not a partial-day window. A partial-day removal (a
/// lunch, an afternoon-only block) is modeled instead as an <see cref="Occupancy.Blocking"/> event,
/// which free/busy subtracts as occupancy. The span is INCLUSIVE of both <see cref="Start"/> and
/// <see cref="End"/> (a one-day vacation is <c>Start == End</c>), matching the way a user reads "off
/// from the 9th through the 13th".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two supply-side homes for the same mechanism.</b> A <see cref="ResourceAvailability"/> carries
/// per-resource exception spans (this resource's own vacation / personal closure); a
/// <see cref="SharedCalendar"/> carries org/location-wide exception spans (a clinic holiday that
/// applies to every subscribed resource). Both expand the same way (the day is suppressed); the
/// difference is scope (one resource vs. a subscribed set). The free/busy composition unions both
/// before differencing against availability.
