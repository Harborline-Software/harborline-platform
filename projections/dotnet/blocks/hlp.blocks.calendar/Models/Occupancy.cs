/// Free/busy is computed as <c>availability windows − ALL occupancy (Bookable AND Blocking)</c>: a
/// doctor's lunch is a <see cref="Blocking"/> event that removes the slot from free/busy even though
/// it is not an appointment, and a booked appointment is a <see cref="Bookable"/> event that consumes
/// availability. Both make the resource <i>busy</i>; the distinction is whether the time was a
/// bookable appointment of the resource (<see cref="Bookable"/>) or an internal block on it

/// the typed <c>EventType</c> + payload + billable/productive flags on top; the calendar never learns
