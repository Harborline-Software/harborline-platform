/**
 * Declarative workflow-definition contract (WF-KEY — the process keystone of
 * ADR 0140; a thin authoring shape over the ADR 0135 durable process engine).
 *
 * This is the process-half analog of `FormDefinition` (./forms.ts): the editable,
 * content-addressed TEMPLATE (FE-3's **Workflow**) that the visual workflow-builder
 * authors and the ADR 0135 engine instantiates into a **Process**
 * (`WorkflowInstanceRecord`). It is the data-driven authoring shape of a hand-written
 * typed `IWorkflowStepHandler` — states / guarded transitions / triggers / actions
 * as DATA, not C#.
 *
 * WF-KEY adds NO new runtime primitive and NO new authority primitive:
 *  - triggers map 1:1 onto the engine's existing `WorkflowTriggerKind`;
 *  - guards / action-conditions are `RuleDefinition`-shaped boolean expressions
 *    (SPINE-1 `harborline-jsonlogic/v1`), evaluated by the rule engine's
 *    `IGuardEvaluator` — the SAME engine the form rules use, extended only with the
 *    `wf.` / `timer.` context-addressing prefixes (see @harborline-software/rule-engine grammar);
 *  - actions are guarded capability-calls carrying an authoring-declared CP / AP
 *    classification (ADR 0128) that drives the CP-park safety fence.
 *
 * THE SAFETY FENCE (ADR 0135 Amendment 2026-06-24, the deferred A1 interpreter gate).
 * This contract is PRECISELY the input schema the deferred data-driven interpreter
 * (A1) would consume. In WF-KEY v1 a `WorkflowDefinition` is AUTHORED, VALIDATED
 * (`validateWorkflowAdmission`, ./workflow-admission.ts — the authoring-time
 * CP-reachability gate), STORED and SIMULATED — it is NOT executed by a general
 * interpreter. Live execution stays gated behind A1 + the broker-PEP. The validator
 * is the authoring face of A1's R-1 load-time validator: it refuses the very graphs
 * R-1 would refuse to load, surfaced at design time instead of load time.
 *
 * Canonical source parity: the .NET mirror is
 * `packages/blocks-workflow/src/durable/WorkflowDefinitionModel.cs` (+ the matching
 * `WorkflowAdmissionValidator.cs`). Field names are camelCase to match the ASP.NET
 * Core serialiser the node host returns. A drift between the two is what
 * `__tests__/workflow.test.ts` pins.
